The test task requires Python 3.10+
There is no external dependencies are used so there is no need to install any additional modules. The requirements.txt points to pyinstaller to compile single binary.

To launch the game please run following command (Mac):
```
python3 src/tetris.py
```
Windows:
```
python src/tetris.py
```
I also added 'tetris' bash script to launch the task on Mac.
